## GUI Login

This process will be the same for all GUI based SCINet Services. Please follow the instructions below.  If you have further questions or issues, please email [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](scinet_vrsc@usda.gov). 
 
### Accessing Using LincPass

If you are a LincPass holder, you will only select the option of "USDA LincPass" when logging into GUI services such as Open OnDemand, Galaxy, and the SCINet Forum. 

After selcting this, you will be automatically directed to login using your usual eAuth based login.

### Accessing Using login.gov

- When logging into a GUI based system, you will be presented with the following image 
	- You will select “Login.gov or USDA LincPass”

- If prompted, you will then select “Customer”

- Then, you will select “Login.gov”

- This will redirect you to login.gov for you to sign in. If you already have an existing login.gov account, there is no need for you to create a new one. You can simply sign in with your existing information. 
	- However, if you need to create an account, you will toggle from “Sign In” to “Create an account.”

- Once you fill out the required information, you will be sent an email to confirm your account.  Confirming your email will redirect you back to login.gov for you to set up a password and second authentication method. 

- More information on account set up can be found [here](https://www.login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/)

- Once you have completed the account setup, you will need to select “Continue without linking to an existing eAuth account” to move forward.

- Once you have successfully authenticated with login.gov, you should see a similar image to the successful logins for LincPass/Yubikey:

If you need assistance with this login process, please email your questions to [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](scinet_vrsc@usda.gov).
