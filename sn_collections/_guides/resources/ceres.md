## Onboarding Videos
Users who are new to the HPC environment may benefit from the following Ceres onboarding video which covers much of the material contained in this guide plus some Unix basics.

[Ceres Onboarding (Intro to SCINet Ceres HPC) (length 42:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FspDMlHaJUY)

Note: /KEEP storage discussed in the video at 16:20 is no longer available. Instead data that cannot be easily reproduced should be manually backed up to [Juno]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/data/storage/#juno-archive-storage). The instructional video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lnsCAfx3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lnsCAfx3Q) demonstrates how to transfer files between local computer, Ceres, Atlas and Juno using Globus.

The video includes:
- logging on to Ceres
- changing your password
- home and project directories
- data transfer to/from SCINet clusters
- basic SLURM job scheduler commands
- computing in interactive mode with salloc
- accessing Ceres software modules
- computing in batch mode with a batch script


## Technical Overview

Ceres is the dedicated high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for ARS researchers on ARS SCINet. Ceres is designed to enable large-scale computing and large-scale storage. Currently, the following compute nodes are available on the Ceres cluster.

100 regular compute nodes, each having:

* 72 logical cores on 2 x 18 core Intel Xeon Processors (6240 2.60GHz 25MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 384GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand

76 regular compute nodes, each having:

* 96 logical cores on 2 x 24 core Intel Xeon Processors (6240R 2.40GHz 36MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 384GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand

2 large memory nodes, each having:

* 80 logical cores on 2 x 20 core Intel Xeon Processors (6248 2.50GHz 27.5MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 768GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand


6 large memory nodes, each having:

* 80 logical cores on 2 x 20 core Intel Xeon Processors (6248 2.50GHz 27.5MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 1,536GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand


11 large memory nodes, each having:

* 96 logical cores on 2 x 24 core Intel Xeon Processors (6248R 3GHz 27.5MB Cache or 6248 2.50GHz 27.5MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 1,536GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand


1 GPU node that has:

* 72 logical cores on 2 x 18 core Intel Xeon Processors (6140 2.30GHz 25MB Cache) with hyper-threading turned ON
* 2 Tesla V100
* 384GB DDR3 ECC Memory
* 250GB Intel DC S3500 Series 2.5” SATA 6.0Gb/s SSDs (used to host the OS and provide small local scratch storage)
* 1.5TB SSD used for temporary local storage
* Mellanox ConnectX®­3 VPI FDR InfiniBand


In addition there are a specialized data transfer node and several service nodes.

In aggregate, there are more than 9000 compute cores (18000 logical cores) with 110 terabytes (TB) of total RAM, 500TB of total local storage, and 3.7 petabyte (PB) of shared storage.

Shared storage consists of 2.3PB high-performance Lustre space, 1.4PB high-performance BeeGFS space and 300TB of backed-up ZFS space.


## System Configuration
Since most HPC compute nodes are dedicated to running HPC cluster jobs, direct access to the nodes is discouraged. The established HPC best practice is to provide login nodes. Users access a login node to submit jobs to the cluster’s resource manager (SLURM), and access other cluster console functions. All nodes run on Linux CentOS 7.8.
