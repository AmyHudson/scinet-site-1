Galaxy will be unavailable between 9AM - 5PM on 11/14/2023  
Downtime is required to change the location of galaxy related paths from /90daydata to /project

Background - Galaxy saves upload, output and intermediate files in /90daydata on Ceres. The 90daydata file system is experiencing frequent performance issues that is causing job timeouts and, in some extreme cases, job failures

Changes - During maintenance, the paths to upload, output and intermediate files will be set to /project as this is performant and is still under warranty. This is our current best option for Galaxy.

Notes - Only new files created after the maintenance will be saved in /project, existing files will still remain on /90daydata(reminder that these files will be purged by the filesystem after 90days so please save them elsewhere)
