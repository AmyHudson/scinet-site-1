## Preworkshop instructions: 

* **Logging on to [Atlas Open OnDemand (OOD)](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/):** Please confirm you can successfully log in to Atlas OOD with your SCINet account [(see instructions here)](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). If you are successful, you will be able to see the Atlas OOD home page.
* **Atlas Shell Access:** When on Atlas OOD, click on the top navigation bar: “Clusters” > “Atlas Shell Access”. A new tab will appear that looks like a shell terminal (e.g., like PowerShell). Please confirm you do not receive any error messages or requests to re-authenticate and that the final line looks like "[firstname.lastname@atlas-login-1 ~]$". 
* **JupyterLab Server:** Back on the main Atlas OOD tab, click on the top or side navigation bar: "Interactive Apps" > "JupyterLab Server".  
  * Fill the input fields with the following (input fields not listed below can be left at their default values):  
    * Partition: atlas
    * Number of hours: 1
    * Number of nodes: 1
    * Number of tasks: 1
    * Additional Slurm Parameters: (leave empty)
  * Click the "Launch" button. 
  * Wait a moment for the job card to update from "Queued" to "Running". 
  * Please confirm that clicking on the "Connect to JupyterLab Server" button opens a new tab with the JupyterLab Server interface. 
* **RStudio Server:** Back on the main Atlas OOD tab, click on the top or side navigation bar: "Interactive Apps" > "RStudio Server". Repeat the same steps as for JupyterLab Server to confirm you can launch an RStudio Server session.
