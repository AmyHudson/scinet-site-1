In this interactive, hands-on workshop, you will learn how to use SCINet's computing resources to convert raw DNA sequencing data into a complete genome assembly. Along the way, you will also learn best practices for ensuring that your genome assemblies are robust and useful for downstream analyses. <!--excerpt--> Anyone with at least a little command-line experience (you don't need to be an expert!) is welcome to join us! 

In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:  
* **Assembly Fundamentals:** Understand the assumptions and limitations in genome assembly due to biology, sequencing technology, and assembly tools. 
* **Hands-On Coding:** Complete a genome assembly from start to finish: quality control, assembly, scaffolding, and polishing. 
* **Evaluation of Assemblies:** Not all genomes are equal! Gain the expertise to critically assess the quality of a genome assembly.
