The SCINet initiative contributes funding to various working groups that use SCINet computational resources for research. The funding is generally used to convene in-person group workshops. There are also two working groups that develop SCINet learning/training materials.


The current working groups are:
* [Ag100Pest Initiative (subgroup of AGR)]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/ag100pest)
* [Arthropod Genomics Research (AGR) Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/arthropods)
* [Geospatial Research Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/geospatial)
* [Microbiome Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/microbiome)
* [Pollinator Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/pollinator)
* [SCINet-Longterm Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Phenology Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/LTARphenology)
* [Protein Function and Phenotype Prediction Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/proteinfunction)
* [Translational Omics Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/omics)
