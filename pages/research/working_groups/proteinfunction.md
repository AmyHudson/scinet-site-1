This working group was formed as the result of a December 2021 SCINet-sponsored symposium, AI at the Frontiers of Protein Science for Agriculture. The focus of the group is to facilitate community and collaboration for use of SCINet resources to advance research activity in protein function, structure, and phenotype prediction.  The group is comprised of scientists already using SCINet resources and scientists interested in utilizing SCINet for their research. This group will provide collaborate on workflows, present results, and create training and workbook resources for ARS scientists.

If you would like to join the group, please contact Hye-Seon Kim ([hyeseon.kim@usda.gov](hyeseon.kim@usda.gov)) or Carson Andorf ([carson.andorf@usda.gov](carson.andorf@usda.gov)).
