- This will redirect you to login.gov for you to sign in. If you already have an existing login.gov account, there is no need for you to create a new one. You can simply sign in with your existing information. 
	- However, if you need to create an account, you will toggle from “Sign In” to “Create an account.”

- Once you fill out the required information, you will be sent an email to confirm your account.  Confirming your email will redirect you back to login.gov for you to set up a password and second authentication method. 

- More information on account set up can be found [here](https://www.login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/)

- Once you have completed the account setup, you will need to select “Continue without linking to an existing eAuth account” to move forward.
