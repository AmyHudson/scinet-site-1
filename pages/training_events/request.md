We are always looking for new scientific computing training ideas and needs in ARS! Suggestions for workshops or trainings are accepted through our training [request form]().
If you are interested in leading the training yourself, please indicate that in the additional comments section in the form.

Our trainings and events are provided by the SCINet Office and ARS's AI-COE, our collaborators within ARS, and our external collaborators. Recent trainings have been developed in collaboration with:
* [The Carpentries](/training/carpentries)
* [Iowa State University](/events/scinet-corner)
* [Mississippi State University](/events/intro-to-atlas)
* [SCINet Working Groups](/research/working-groups/)
* [The University of Florida](/training/practicum-ai)
