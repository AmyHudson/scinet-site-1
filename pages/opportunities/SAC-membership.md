The SCINet Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) is seeking representatives from the Northeast Area (2 positions), Pacific West Area (1 position), and Statistics (1530 series) (1 position) to serve for 3-year terms beginning March 2024.

The SAC helps ensure that SCINet meets the scientific computing needs of ARS researchers. SAC members represent a broad range of scientific research at ARS and membership includes two researchers from each of the five ARS geographic areas, a statistician, and an “at-large” member. The SAC meets monthly to provide input on planning, education, and communication activities of the SCINet Initiative. For example, SAC members help organize instructional workshops, maintain a body of scientific points-of-contact across ARS research units, and help identify unmet scientific computing needs in ARS. There is also opportunity for input on policy initiatives. SAC progress and issues are elevated to the Executive Committee for review and approval. 

Please consider sharing your time and talents by serving on the SAC. These are 3-year terms which begin Spring 2024 and will end Spring 2027.  **Please send your nominations (including self-nominations) to ([Kathleen.yeater@usda.gov](mailto:Kathleen.yeater@usda.gov)) by COB on Friday February 16, 2024.** Please provide e-mail contact information of nominees. Self-nominations are encouraged; if you self-nominate, please provide a paragraph summarizing your desire to serve on the committee.
